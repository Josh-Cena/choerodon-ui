**Precautions**

> Pro Table has many integrated functions and complex logic. Therefore, when you need to display a large amount of data on a single page, you must pay attention to it before selecting the development technology.

**Reference for large data volume scenarios:**

Refer to [Sum of functions demo](#ALL), 1000 items (2w+ cells) are displayed on a single page under this complexity, and the loading time is more than 10s, about 11s.


**Processing plan**

> According to the specific scenarios and requirements, it is recommended that it takes more than 10s to load and use the big data table [PerformanceTable](/zh/procmp/data-display/performance-table) or refer to [virtual scrolling demo](#Virtual%20Scroll) for processing.
